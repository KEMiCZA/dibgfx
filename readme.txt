  INFORMATION ON HOW TO USE MY TRAINERS
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  USAGE/NOTE:
  1) Run trainer and game
  2) Press F1 to enable the trainer (IMPORTANT!!)
  3) Use your desired hotkey to enable/disable a cheat

  Additionally you can use the built in hotkey editor to create your own table
  of hotkeys. What you basically do when entering a hotkey at a certain 
  position is overwriting that hotkey. Eventually you'll get a kem.ini file in 
  the same folder as the trainers exe. The ini file should be placed 
  in the same folder as the games exe. To make it easier for yourself just 
  place the trainers exe in the games folder (create a shortcut). And everytime 
  you change your hotkeys the file will be automatically stored in the correct 
  folder. You can't edit the keys if the trainer is already activated. Do this
  before you actually start the game or press F1. 

  If you would like to use the original hotkeys again, just remove the
  ini file from the games folder.

  VERY IMPORTANT!
  Make sure you run the trainer in administrator mode. And add it to your
  exception list if you have an anti virus program/firewall.

  Trainer tested on Win7, on the no-cd/steam version Enjoy! See top for
  specific version.
